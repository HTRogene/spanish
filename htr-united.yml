description: >-
  HTRogène is an exploratory project funded by Biblissima+, aiming to develop
  generic models for automatic transcription of medieval and early modern
  manuscripts.  

  This repository focuses on the Medieval Spanish corpus, providing ground-truth
  data for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and layout segmentation.  

  The dataset is designed to support the creation of robust and reliable HTR
  models for Spanish manuscripts.
